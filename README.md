Client Appointment Management System. 

As a nutritionist, I was thinking of having a system for managing client data for each appointment (sort of like some hospitals/clinics/health facilities).

And when I saw an ad for a Health and Wellness Expo, I thought of building a project for it. The idea was to sign up for the expo and show it off.

Plus I thought it would be a nice challenge to build something useful with Nuxt 3  and  Prisma
